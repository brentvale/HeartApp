# HearTapp
HearTapp uses the brain's amazing ability to lock on to and accurately communicate a signal.  Remember calibrating your guitar in Guitar Hero...strum the guitar every time a dot passes over a target area.  Our brains are amazing!  This project tests a hypothesis that a heart rate can be accurately obtained by clicking or tapping out the heart rate.  
##Real World Application  
Put a tablet under a doctor or nurse's finger as they tap out a newborn's umbilical heart rate (to communicate it to a team) and you have a heart rate entry mechanism for driving a tablet decision guidance system that relies on a newborn's heart rate.  Pretty cool, huh?  Check it out and click out your own heart rate at: [link]
